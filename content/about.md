Hi! I'm Archit Dwivedi, might be better known to you as evi1haxor. I'm an undergraduate student at [Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur](https://iitj.ac.in/) in the department of [Bioscience and Bioengineering](http://iitj.ac.in/department/index.php?id=biology). 

I adore lots of music, you will catch me doing programming or reading books in my free time. In books, I'm inclined more on Science & Science popular than Self- improvement genre and more on Self- improvement than fiction genre. Personal favourites are- **Cosmos: Carl Sagan**, **Surely you're joking Mr. Feynman: Adventures of curious character as told to Ralph Leighton**; among Self-improvement I'd ever read, I like to re-read one, and each time I read, I learn something new or should I say, I *realise* something knew. They call it **Lose not Your Heart: Shriram Sharma Acharya**, only a 31 page book, but of big thoughts! Some others of similar kind which deserve a mention is **Brainstorm: Eric Maisel and Ann Maisel** and **Evolve Your Brain: Joe Dispenza**, specially the latter one.

I love to go on  short distance solo travelling- may be on bicycle or on foot sometimes. In programming, I have thorough experience in C++, slight experience in HTML5 and CSS3, thou I'm self learning python, you can track my progress on [Pyathlon](https://github.com/evi1haxor/pyathlon). I also know [this](https://github.com/evi1haxor/brainfuckery). And in near or far future, I'll be learning— *I don't reveal my future plans..sorry*

This is not my first blog. Tho it is my first of its kind. This blog is powered by Hugo- a static site generator, and hosted on- netlify. Source code is available on GitHub. I'd made my previous blog through Jekyll. The main reason of abandoning the Jekyll blog is not only the curiosity to try something new (Hugo in this case), but is that I don't have a good machine to run Jekyll on. Just to let you know, I code on my mobile phone [$TERMUX$](http://termux.com)..yeah I know, it's really awful.

I sometimes take photos. You can check them on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/evi1haxor/) right away.

I love to celebrate the thought that this particular moment that has just passed will never return. I just typed 'typed' I can't type 'typed' at the same old moment anymore! I celebrate *most of the* thoughts which comes to me. Check them on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/evi1haxor). 

I have a channel on Telegram. Just in case you feel an urge to join- [E̕͟͢1҉̸̷̧̧͞i̢xi̵̵̸̵͟͠ŗ̸҉҉̸̨͝](https://t.me/E1ixir)

I'm on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/archit.dwivedi.1848/). I won't force you to add me as a friend 'cause I'm not much active in there. No harm in adding tho.

You might find most of my content on Twitter or Facebook or Telegram channel, same. That's because I use [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com). Tho, some out of many won't be same (for example, Twitter API that ifttt use, doesn't post direct retweets without comments). And I'm lazy enough to change the applets for them.

An appeal: **THIS PAGE IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO UPDATES.** Well, you don't expect me to be a man of *one* kind of interest throughout the life. Do you? As I get more on me, this page shall be updated. So keep an eye on the timeline page, if you want to, ofcourse. Second thing is— you might find the post a little shabbily maintained. I need to work on *Texonomies* for that. I'll do it as I get a machine to work on (short on resources here!)


So here I welcome you aboard! It's time to set sail from anguish to whimsy turmoil via debilitating lethargy.
