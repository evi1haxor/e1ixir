Such an accident that we happened to happen! Sometimes I use to think about the way everything is, and I suspend in the zero; in a sensible world full of nonsense yet with sense! Believe it..!

Recently I read an article claiming that the Three Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebula been disrupted by the flairs associated with nearby tremendous explosion. Though, the affect is not yet visible from the earth, as an estimate they said probably in 1000 years or so it will be visible from the earth. Ah! The Pillars of Creation! But now ceases to be some. Couldn't even secure its own beingness!

This made me wonder, through what conditions and circumstances the particle that makes us today has gone through. Hitherto making something like us! Humans! Intelligent enough to explore the reason of its own existence..

# Why the way is it, that the way it is?!?

## Answering the When—

Since the time human consciousness has became independent, it started questioning. Questioning about How? Why? When? Where?.. among all, the question which baffled him the most- "Since when we'd been here? And how did we end up here in the first place!?". Different theories were put and repudiated. And now, The Big Bang Theory is globally accepted. Moreover, the after-heat of this enormous event have been detected not long ago- [Cosmic Microwave Background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background)
The event, to the best of the knowledge at the moment, occured 13.8 billion years ago. Everything! Everything that you can spot nearby or aloofed, even everything else which you cannot spot, even the energy you're consuming to read this snippet (hopefully) ALL of it happened to, apparantly, pop up into existence from a pin point 13.8 billion years ago! Oh! Does it sound like *last 13.8 billion yearism* like *last Thursdayism*, if it does, let me be sorry for miscommunication..
Whatsoever you see, didn't just showed up on clarion call. It took painstaking efforts in the name of time, that this intricate gravel we see today is the way, the way it is.

Just after the big bang, nothing was stable. not even a photon was there, neither anything featuring some negatively charged particles shackled around an equally positively charge particle now known as atom of some element. Gradually surroundings ebbed, surging electrons captured by the protons. Thenceforth, formed first stable atom of hydrogen. The atoms started to drawn to each other making large and dense clound clusters. Density that Helium atoms started to form. Now clounds had hydrogen and helium. These clouds eventually started getting denser and denser, until they got so hot, that nuclear reactions started to occur. Therefrom, first star was born! Stars, formed...presto they go nova! These were massive and short lived. They used to collect so much matter that they went so massive and dense that they eventually explode and sprew themselves out loud! Early universe was occupied by this cycle of star formation and novae. But this cumbersome didn't go idle. this was the period when elements like carbon, silicon, sulphur, nitrogen and other not-so-predominant(on cosmic perspective) elements formed. These elements formed rocks, ice chunks which we see in comets now, and other molecules.
As the universe expanded, this rigorous cycle of star formation and explosion slowed down. Stars, now tend to live longer that the early universe. Tho, [collisions](https://www.instagram.com/p/BlJTzvIAFHP/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=eamzupv8g7cx) of stars in some binary or higher order star system (higher the order, lower is the probability of their practical existence) also rarefied the population of stars. Let's answer the how now, shall we?


## Answering the How—

It all started 4.6 billion years ago when sun just turned on anew. While the sun was heating up, there were hundreds and thousands of large clumps of gases and rocks orbiting around the brightness. Those gases blew away by the tremendous solar winds. Moreover, the gases weren't any near to the sun. Because sun formation might haven't allowed lighter, smaller and gaseous reservoire of particles in the inner solar system. Even today we see, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars are predominantly solid rocks while beyond astroid belt, we have gas giants. All this happened just after the sun tuned on, then next millions of years witnessed a *battle for supremacy* between hundreds of rocks may be smaller or bigger than the earth. *Survival of the fittest!* law let only five planets to sustain in their descret domain. "Five?" you ask, "Is it the asteroid belt counting the fifth?" you add..I explain- Nope! Asteroid belt isn't the remains of planet destroyed, actually they are some of those debris of rocks which once orbited round with many others, which now are in us, on our desks, may be you are sitting over some part of them, or some part of them might have now become some part of you, etc.. Instead, the fifth count I made was for something called planet Theia(and I don't know how to pronounce it. May be *theya* with *then* type pronunciation of *th*).

There's a theory about how moon formed on collision of planet Theia with the Earth.

I can go on and on and on...in a single post already! So I think I should desist this post to stockpile some content for my future post. So I request you to invite the man with a new post for it. Till then, ponder..
