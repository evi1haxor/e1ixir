The idea of the elements and atoms is not new. The thought encompasses it's foundation, back from over 2.5 millennia! <Img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evi1haxor/e1ixir/master/static/Screenshot_2018-10-12-23-58-57-142_com.android.chrome.png" align = "left" height= 260px /> _Democritus:_ One of the greatest philosopher mankind has ever had. His theory argues the indivisibility of atom. In his theory, he claimed that there must exist different kinds of atom, with different masses and sizes. These different kinds of atom, then constitute observable objects. However, he added, the characteristics like taste, colour and feel of touch emanates from the different ways the atoms might arrange in. Fundamentally, his philosophy scratches the surface of modern idea of chemical bonding and characteristics of the atom, pretty well.
For others the thought was so ahead of time that they laughed at him. Though, early Greek philosophers used to propose their ideas just by thought processing and logic, and not by experiments. And that's why it's said for Greek philosophers: __"All thoughts and no action!"__ So most of the time, they had ideas, they had plans, but they just don't want to toil for justifying it through real life experiences.

Next when the topic caught the heat was during 1800s with Dalton's intelligent findings. A few ethos from Dalton's early Modern atomic theory are-
‌
* All matter is composed of extremely small particles called atoms.

* Atoms of a given element are identical in size, mass, and other properties. Atoms of different elements differ in size, mass, and other properties.

* Atoms cannot be subdivided, created, or destroyed.

* Atoms of different elements can combine in simple whole number ratios to form chemical compounds.

* In chemical reactions, atoms are combined, separated, or rearranged.

You'd probably been taught the dossiers on this in school. So I won't take trouble to explain them unnecessarily.

_Science is the study of conclusions._ All the theories must be driven by logical arguments derived from well designed experiments. Superfluously mentioning,that these theories are susceptible to refinement (if needed) with subsequent experiments. And that's the best thing about the Science culture. All of the little idea about _the atom_ that we have today is solely based on experiments and observations.
 For such a small of an atom, many experiments were performed. Thence, proposing numerous _models_ of the atomic structure. But wait....why the _models_..? Well, you see, (oh! Actually you can't see...that's the real problem) our eyes can detect minimum size of 400nm (lower limit of λ of the visible region of the spectrum). So, human can't see the atoms unsupported, which is as small as of the order 3 × 10<sup>-7</sup> m. That's why there are _models_ of the structure of an atom, 'cause that _model_ tag give it the uncertainty in correctness.

 So, typed some important experiments herein, which had put the foundation of our modern perception of atomic theory.

## A Few Laboratory Affairs

### Electrical Nature

> "I have such conviction that the power which governs electrodecomposition and ordinary chemical attractions is the same."

That was Faraday been quoted, back from 1833 when he proposed a quite pensive conclusions from his investigations of electrolysis, which not only gave a slight clue of electrical nature of matter, but also, strongly argued the law of chemical combination, which furthermore say a lot about existence of atoms(his second statement as mentioned below)

#### Faraday's Law of electrodecomposition:

1. A given amount of electricity will always deposit the same weight of a given material at an electrode.
2. The weight of various materials deposited evolved, or dissolved at an electrode by a fixed amount of electricity are proportional to the equivalent weight of these substances.

Considering the first law, we can say, if a fixed amount of electricity influences (oxidise or reduce) a fixed number of atoms, then electricity itself must have its constituting particles. Thereby, in 1874, the word _electron_ was proposed by *G.J. Stoney*, for those **hypothetical** fundamental electrical particles. Hypothetical because, still there wasn't any proofs of experiments for their existence. It took 23 whopping years, that is 1897, when a strong evidence claiming the existence of electrons came up.

#### Cathode ray experiment

The experiment was intended to study the conducting property of gases at low pressure. Gases are electrically insulators in ordinary conditions, they, however, _break down_ and start conducting, if subjected to high voltage metal electrodes, with light emission as a signature of the episode. During other subsequent experiments, experimentalists tried to tinker around. So they induced a small fan like structure inside the tube just to see, as usual. When they applied the voltage across the terminals, they found the fan like structure rotation! This clearly showed that what they were calling the _Ray_ (like Cathode RAY) are actually particles, heavy enough to transcend their momentum to the wings of the fan. The thing that misguided them to believe that those were rays was that when they put an opaque object in the path of those rays, it made shadow impression  on the opposite wall of cathode. It's not like photons don't pass on their momentum, it's just that it doesn't suffices the fan to move. Then, however, noone took the pain to modify the name.

You can further read about discovery of electron, proton and neutron [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle). It is the least of what I've got for you here (wait for QED!). Although, I would like to take the courtesy to write a separate post dedicated to Nucleus.


#### Millican's Oil Drop Experiment

_Millican_ was an American physicist who was awarded Noble Prize in Physics in 1923 for his work in Particle Physics(mainly elementary electronic charge) and photoelectric effect.<br>

**A Little more about Robert A. Millican:** Millican had had a share of contribution in photoelectric effect. This unusual phenomenon- photoelectric effect, was first discovered by a German physicist Heinrich Rudolf Hertz in 1887. The hottest reason why it caught moot among the physics community of that time was that this phenomenon cannot be explained by classical physics, which takes light as electromagnetic wave. As classical physics suggest that kinetic energy of ejected electron must increase on increasing the intensity, but here, results depicts a whole set of data results, that it doesn't even depend on intensity. It varies linearly with frequency instead. Like-
![Einstein's photoelectric equation for kinetic energy of ejected electron](http://mathurl.com/yb6l94f9.png)<br>

 Another incomprehensible observation that they got was that there was virtually no time lag between irradiation and electron emission.<br>
This perplexing behaviour of light-matter interaction led Albert Einstein to formulate photon hypothesis in 1905. He, in his theory tried to pursued us to _believe_ in a very `uncommonsensy` thought, that light is made of particles. Well, what to say...it's his way of dealing with stuff. He named them _Photons_. He stated that each photons carries a specific amount of energy, given by ![E=h\nu](http://mathurl.com/celhkrc.png) <br>
> That equation! That damn equation! It has got a story of its own. Will write about it too someday.<br>

Millican carefully examined the results and verified Einstein's equation to high precision which apparently got him a Nobel prize.

Anyways, going with the Oil drop experiment (1909) by Millican and Fletcher- An intelligent setup that was designed to measure the elementary charge on the electron utilising the tools from classical physics only. <IMG src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evi1haxor/e1ixir/master/static/Screenshot_2018-09-28-00-36-00-310_com.android.chrome.png" align="left" height=300px/>

The arrangement consist of a spray bottle (atomiser) which sprays the oil contained in it, in fine and consistently small sized droplets.
<IMG src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evi1haxor/e1ixir/c1b6c952370b12b646e151bb516a4fac828ca716/static/IMG_20180928_012042.jpg" align="right" height=200px /> These droplets then enters a room of two compartments stacked one over the other. The lower compartment has uniform electric field which can be varied through external system. Lower compartment is irradiated with X-Rays in order to ionise the oil drop, so now they move upward under tghe influence if electric field.

So now if I do some math with <br>
